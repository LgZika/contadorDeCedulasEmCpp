Subject: Meeting to discuss ATM counting software

Dear Mr Glauber,

I'd like to schedule a meeting with you and your team to discuss implementing my new ballot counting software into your ATM network.

Could it be May 29th at 8pm? Let me know if this date works for you.

Best Regards,
Luiz Gustavo D. Pulz.
